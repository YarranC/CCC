# CCC solutions and automated tester
tester/ folder contains a python script, 'parser.py', that can be used to automatically test your CCC solutions written in python.
please name your solution like j1,py, and put the CCC official *.in and *.out in folder like j1/. Put parser.py in the same folder as j1.py. Run parser.py, will feed the *.in to your j1.py, and compare the output with *.out. It will print out the status of each test case and indicate the pass/fail of each one.

July 5, 2024: committed first version of the tester and 2024 CCC Junior test solution written in python.
